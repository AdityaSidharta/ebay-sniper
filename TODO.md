# TODO

- Use rust and ty instead of mypy and pylint and flake8
- Do we still need fastapi in this architecture? Do we need API Handler in this architecture, since we are using API Gatewway
- Do we still need KMS in this architecture?
- What is the difference between UserPool and UserPoolClient?
- What about the other functionalities? Don't we need a lambda for that?
- Don't need real time update on the bid, it will only be refreshed whenever the user open or refresh the page
